# DeepSolar-California
A predictive analysis project to assist solar system retailer and policy regulators in the State of California.

## Motivation and Objective

In recent years, solar systems have been getting enormous attention due to the increase in the price of electric energy and decreasing cost of solar panels across the world. Moreover, governments have been supporting the public with incentives to install solar systems in their homes. The use of solar systems in homes plays a crucial part in protecting the universe by reducing the amount of harmful gasses released to generate electrical energy. Due to these environmental and economic benefits, the deployment of solar energy facilities has recently been growing across many parts of the world. However, in this project, I will analyze and illustrate solar systems deployment in the State of California. To better understand the distribution and relationships of solar systems deployment using the data, we will numerically and visually present the relationships between different parameters of solar system deployment.

Focusing on analyzing and formulating a predictive model for solar power deployment across the United States of America, this project will be a great help to solar panel retailers, regulatory agencies, power generating companies. This project will use the SolarDeep dataset to analyze the distribution of solar power systems installed in relation with the socioeconomic and environmental parameters. These analyses will help solar retailers and regulatory agencies and power system companies to comprehend the relationships and hence, expand their business. Moreover, I have built a predictive model that would help these companies and agencies in taking business decisions based on the projections of the data at different times and different locations.
